In this project I took some JS script used in a Codecademy lessson and tried to bring it to life.

Using HTML and CSS, I ended up with a simple looking web app that calculates if you are behind on sleep.

The JS script is within the HTML file - this is something I know to be bad form so in my next project I will try and work with distinct JS and HTML files.
