<h1>Sleep Calculator</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

In this project I took some JS script used in a *Codecademy* lesson and tried to bring it to life.

Using HTML and CSS, I ended up with a simple looking web app.

<h3>Process</h3>

I wanted a way to input the user's sleep other than simply typing it in, so I looked for a slider. 

Eventually, I used these [range sliders](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp) and put them into the code.

Then I built these in to the table which displays the app. 

The JS script is within the HTML file - this is something I know to be bad form so in my next project I will try and work with distinct JS and HTML files.

Once the HTML and JS was working, I spent a *long* time playing around with CSS to make it look nice. 

The project started with a simple gradient background, but I found this [cloud animation](https://codepen.io/P3R0/pen/RPbgaX) which makes it a little more interesting.

Finally, I found a font (*ChunkFive-Regular*) I liked and used *@fontface* to bring it to the project.
